# Incident Management

When a new incident is identified, the first and most critical step is to ensure it is promptly registered. At this early stage, many details such as severity, affected systems, or responsible teams may still be unclear. For this reason, it is essential to have a flexible and lightweight incident registration process that enables teams to act without delay.

A streamlined registration method allows responders to immediately begin containing the incident, mitigating its impact, and initiating the investigation process, rather than being slowed down by administrative overhead. This agility is vital in the early moments of an incident, when time is of the essence.

As the situation evolves and more context becomes available, the incident record can be progressively updated to reflect new information. This dynamic approach ensures that operational focus remains on response and resolution, rather than documentation, ultimately improving incident handling and reducing potential damage.

## Outcome

- [ ] A formal, documented process is in place for managing security incidents.
- [ ] A clear and shared definition of what constitutes an incident is established.
- [ ] An individual or designated team is responsible for incident management.
- [ ] An on-call team is available to respond to incidents as needed.
  - [ ] A system is in place to grant granular, time-limited privileged access to incident responders for managing high or critical severity incidents.
- [ ] Post-incident reviews are conducted to analyze root causes, improve processes, and strengthen existing controls to prevent recurrence.

## Metrics

- [ ] Number of incidents (per month/quarter/year)
- [ ] Number of open incidents (per month/quarter/year)
- [ ] Average time to detect an incident
- [ ] Average time to respond to an incident
- [ ] Number of incidents by are/department
