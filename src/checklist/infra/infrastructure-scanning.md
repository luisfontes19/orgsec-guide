# Infrastructure Scanning

[TBD]

- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): Identifies misconfigurations and compliance risks in cloud infrastructure.
- Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM): Manages and automates access permissions in cloud environments.
- Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP): Protects cloud workloads, including containers, servers, and serverless functions.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scanning: Detects security issues early in the development process.
- Data Security Posture Management (DSPM): Discovers sensitive data sources and who has access to them.

## Outcome

- [ ] Vulnerability Scanning is performed regularly against the infrastructure
- [ ] The scanning tools are properly customized to reduce false positives
- [ ] Findings are being pushed to the [vulnerability management program](../product-security/vulnerability-management-program.md)
- [ ] Severity/Priority is recalculated based on the asset's criticality/risk
