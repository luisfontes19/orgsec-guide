  - [ ] Standard applications per role are defined if needed
  - [ ] Enforce updates
  - [ ] Force device lock when inactive
  - [ ] SSH Keys are password protected
  - [ ] Enforce EDR
  - [ ] Disable remote logins
  - [ ] User has no admin permissions
- [ ] There's a defined process to quarantine devices
- [ ] Alerts are monitored and acted upon
- [ ] There's a self serve way for users to gain admin access to the devices so they manage it as needed
- [ ] There's a way for users to install applications for their needs, based on a pre-approved list

## Metrics

- [ ] Number/Percentage of devices under MDM
- [ ] Number of detected occurrences
