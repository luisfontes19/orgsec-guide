# Password Manager

A password manager is a vital tool for organizations, complementing existing [Single Sign-On (SSO)](sso.md) systems. While SSO simplifies access to many platforms, it does not cover all tools or services, leaving gaps in the security framework. A password manager addresses these gaps by securely storing credentials for applications that do not support SSO, ensuring consistent and safe access across the organization. Beyond managing passwords, a password manager facilitates the secure sharing of sensitive information such as API keys, encryption keys, or other critical credentials, enabling teams to collaborate without exposing valuable data to unnecessary risks.

An effective password manager enhances security by encouraging the use of strong, unique passwords for every account, minimizing the vulnerabilities associated with weak or reused passwords. It also serves as a critical safeguard in emergencies, providing administrators with tools to recover accounts if credentials are lost or if an employee departs unexpectedly. This recovery capability ensures business continuity while maintaining strict control over access. By integrating a password manager into its security strategy, an organization strengthens its ability to protect sensitive data, fill in the gaps left by SSO, and enable efficient, secure operations.
