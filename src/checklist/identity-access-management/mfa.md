# Multi Factor Authentication

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to verify their identity using two or more factors before accessing a system. These factors can include something the user knows (like a password), something they have (such as a hardware token), or something they are (like a fingerprint).

MFA is essential for organizations as it provides an extra layer of defense against password-based attacks, such as phishing, brute force, or credential stuffing. Even if an attacker obtains a userâ€™s password, they would still need the additional factor to gain access, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Hardware tokens, like YubiKeys, offer one of the most secure forms of two-factor authentication (2FA). They are phishing-resistant because they use cryptographic methods to verify authentication requests, ensuring that credentials can only be sent to legitimate websites or services. This makes them a reliable choice for organizations seeking to strengthen their authentication processes and protect sensitive data from advanced threats.

## Outcome

- [ ] Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for business accounts, prioritizing the use of hardware tokens such as [Yubikeys](https://www.yubico.com/).
- [ ] Develop and document a robust process for MFA resets. Ensure it is manual and includes identity verification for employees.

## Metrics

- [ ] Percentage of users with MFA enabled
- [ ] Number of Logins/MFA requests failed
