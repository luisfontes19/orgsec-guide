# Access Management

[TBD]

## Outcome

- [ ] A flow for requesting permissions is defined and available to everyone in the organization
- [ ] Each tool has a clear owner that can approve or deny access requests
- [ ] A review/approval process is in place, with the owners of the tool being requested to approve
- [ ] A playbook/guide is created on how to review and accept (or not) the access request
- [ ] There's a clear definition of the tools and roles per tool that can be requested and for what
- [ ] Granting access to a tool is automated when possible
- [ ] Privileged access requests are reviewed by a security team
- [ ] A periodic access request review to the tools is in place to ensure permissions are up to date.

## Metrics

- [ ] Users with more accesses
- [ ] Users with more privileged accesses
- [ ] Users with more access requests denied
- [ ] Tools with more access requests requested
- [ ] Tools with more privileged access requests requested
- [ ] Percentage of automated flows for permission granting
