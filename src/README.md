!!! warning
    This project is being developed so there's a lot of content missing, and quite a few bits may be changed

This guide was created to address a common challenge faced by many cybersecurity professionals: the lack of clear, structured guidance on how to build and manage an effective security programs. In my experience as a security engineer, I often found it difficult to understand where to begin, what to prioritize, or how to structure a roadmap for a comprehensive security strategy. This resource is intended to serve as a practical resource to help professionals navigate that journey, offering clarity, direction, and a foundational framework to support their work.
